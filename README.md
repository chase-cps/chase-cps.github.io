CHASE is a framework for requirement capture, formalization, and validation 
for cyber-physical systems.

## Intended Use

CHASE features a modular and extensible software infrastructure that can support
different domain-specific languages, modeling formalisms, and analysis tools. 
It has been applied to industrial design examples, including control of aircraft 
power distribution networks and arbitration of a mixed-criticality automotive bus.

## Publications: 
### A paper about CHASE has been presented at the IEEE/ACM Design Automation and Test in Europe (DATE) conference 2018

## CHASE components and repositories

CHASE is organized in the following components, available at the corresponding
repositories:
- **core-library** (mandatory): the library providing the classes, structures
  required to represents design problems and systems using CHASE. It also
  provides a set of utility classes, functions, and methods to manimulate
  CHASE-based representations. It is the main component of the CHASE framework.

- **chase-backends**: collection of backends tool encoding CHASE problems into
  different external tools, *i.e.*, Slugs, GR1C, NuSMV and PySTL.

- **DSL_tool**: tool using a Domain Specification Language to specify discrete
  timed problems difened over architectures modeled using graphs.

- **Logics_tool**: tool providing a console to manipulate assume-guarantee
  contracts expressed using a logics-based language.
